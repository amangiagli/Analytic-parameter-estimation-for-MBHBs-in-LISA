# Analytic parameter estimation for MBHBs in LISA

This repository is intended to contain the data presented in the work arXiv: (insert link) with an additional tutorial to show how these data can be used. <br />
The repository contains several folders:

1. The folder `data` contain the median, $68\%$ and $95\%$ uncertainties for:
    - Sky position ('skyloc.txt')
    - Luminosity distance ('dl.txt')
    - Chirp mass ('mchirp.txt')
    - Mass-ratio ('mass_ratio.txt')
    - SNR ('SNR.txt')
    
assuming the standard LISA sensitivity curve, as described in Sec.II of (link to arxiv). Refer to the file with ' *_degraded.txt ' for the same quantites computed with the degraded LISA sensitivity.
